# Deep Learning on Fused Brain and Heart Signals for Mental Disorder Detection

It is a non-invasive patient-specific seizure detection/prediction system which utilizes features extracted from EEG and ECG signal. It consists of two main components:
 0. [Seizure detection system](#seizure detection code)
 0. [Seizure prediction system](#seizure prediction code)

This project is funded by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. under GRO Research Agreement.
