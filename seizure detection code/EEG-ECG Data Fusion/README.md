Instructions
------------

1. Download the data by running the shell script `data_setup.sh`, this should be run using  linux shell. 
2. Run the Matlab script `runAll.m` to convert the data from EDF to MAT, do time-frequency analysis, feature extraction, and training and testing with and without the EEG-ECG synchronization features.

NOTE: We provide this source code to illustrate the algorithms and their application. As we state in the midterm report, the dataset used for this preliminary analysis is extremely small--it contains only 3 seizures from a single individual. Therefore the computed results may not be indicative of the performance of the methods in a large dataset, and may vary across different samples of the existing dataset.
